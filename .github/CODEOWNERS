# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# More details are here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/
# The '*' pattern is global owners.
# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# The folders are ordered as follows:
# In each subsection folders are ordered first by depth, then alphabetically.
# This should make it easy to add new rules without breaking existing ones.
# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies Plist files, only @plist-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
